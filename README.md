 Firewall Effectiveness in Cybersecurity 🔥  
[![Academic Research](https://img.shields.io/badge/MSc%20Cybersecurity-University%20Project-blue)]()

This repository presents an academic research paper submitted as part of the MSc Cybersecurity programme at the University of Bradford. The paper critically evaluates the effectiveness of firewalls in modern computing environments — including traditional firewalls, next-gen firewalls, and their role in Zero Trust and cloud architecture.

📄 About the Paper

**Title:** Investigating the Effectiveness of Firewalls in Computer Security and Privacy  
**Author:** Mohammad Arsalan Mahmood  
**Course:** Business Systems Security  
**Word Count:** 1951

---

 📚 Topics Explored

- Evolution of firewalls (packet filtering → NGFWs)
- Real-world breach analysis:
  - Colonial Pipeline (2021)
  - Target Data Breach (2013)
- Firewall integration with:
  - Zero Trust Architecture
  - SIEM and IDS/IPS systems
  - Cloud and container environments (e.g. Kubernetes, Calico)
- Emerging research on AI-driven firewalls
- Limitations around encrypted traffic and cloud visibility

---

 🔍 Key Conclusion

Firewalls remain essential, but they must be integrated with modern detection, identity, and behavioural tools to remain effective. They are no longer sufficient as standalone perimeter solutions.

# Reflections – Firewall Effectiveness Research

This project offered an in-depth opportunity to explore how firewalls continue to evolve in response to modern security challenges. Through the research process, I was able to:

---

 🔍 Key Learning Outcomes

- Deepen my understanding of the **core types of firewalls**, including packet filtering, stateful inspection, proxy-based, and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)
- Critically evaluate **real-world data breaches** to understand how firewall weaknesses or misconfigurations contributed to major incidents (e.g., Colonial Pipeline, Target)
- Explore the shift from **perimeter-based defence to Zero Trust models**
- Understand the integration of firewalls with **SIEM platforms**, **IDS/IPS**, and cloud-native solutions (e.g., Kubernetes, Calico)
- Recognise **limitations** around encrypted traffic inspection, cloud workload visibility, and user behaviour tracking

---

💬 Final Thoughts

While firewalls remain an essential line of defence, they must be part of a broader security strategy that includes **identity, monitoring, and anomaly detection**. This paper helped me understand the practical limitations of firewall deployments and the need for **adaptive, integrated controls** in both on-prem and cloud environments.
